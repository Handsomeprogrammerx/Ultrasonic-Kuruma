# Ultrasonic Kuruma
This robot car is equipped with ultrasonic sensor which allow it to avoid the obstacles, and is controlled by esp8266. The robot will go forward until get to close to the obstacles and will decide whether to go left, right or move backward.

# Skillls Highlight

-Tinkering: Soldering, wiring, and components selecting.

-Programming: Wrote own custom program in C++

-Understanding: Learn about each components: how do they works?, how to use them?, how much they could do.

-Debugging: Overcome hardware error such as power issue, incorrect wiring, and pin limitation. Overcome software problem such as using the unappropriate value for pausing a process, set wrong condition lead to unpredictable behaviours, skipped situations.

# Status

Currently paused,  I haven't done any calculation on the robot's dynamics: linear velocity, rotation velocity, appropriate weight, and stopping time. I used this as a study case for my future projects, for example a self-driving car or self-navigating robot.
